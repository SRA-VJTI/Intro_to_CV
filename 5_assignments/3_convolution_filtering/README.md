## Sobel Edge Detection in X:
   - **Description**:
       - Implement Sobel edge detection with Sobel kernels in horizontal direction.
   - **Input**: 
       - Path of image to be filtered.
   - **Expected Output**: 
       - Two windows depicting difference between original and filtered image.
       - Example : ![](assets/sobel_x.jpg)


## Sobel Edge Detection in Y:
   - **Description**:
       - Implement Sobel edge detection with Sobel kernels in vertical direction.
   - **Input**: 
       - Path of image to be filtered.
   - **Expected Output**: 
       - Two windows depicting difference between original and filtered image.

## Gaussian Smoothning:
   - **Description**:
       - Apply Gaussian smoothing using normal 2D convolution.
   - **Input**: 
       - Path of image to be filtered.
   - **Expected Output**: 
       - Two windows depicting difference between original and filtered image.

## Sharpening:
   - **Description**:
       - Sharpen an image using filter2D method using an appropiate kernel.
   - **Input**: 
       - Path of image to be filtered.
