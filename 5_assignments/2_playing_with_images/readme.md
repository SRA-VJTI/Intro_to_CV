# **Playing with Images Assignment** *(without using OpenCV)*

## **1)** a) Creating a filled rectangle/square in an image:
> In this task we will have to take the length, breath of the square and coordinates of the top left pixel of the square as an input from the user. A filled square of the given coordinates and dimensions should be created in the image.

## b) Creating a filled-circle in an image:
> In this task we will have to take the radius and coordinates of the center of the circle as an input from the user. A filled circle of the given coordinates and dimensions should be created in the image.

## **2)** a) Creating a hollow rectangle/square in an image 
> In this Sub-task we will have to take the length, breadth, thickness of the border of the square and coordinates of the top left pixel of the square as an input from the user. A hollow square of the given coordinates and dimensions should be created in the image.

* **b)** Creating a hollow circle in an image
> In this task we will have to take the radius and coordinates of the center of the circle and also the thickness of the border as an input from the user. A hollow circle of the given coordinates and dimensions should be created in the image.

## 3) Rotating an image by 180 degrees
> In this task you will have to Rotate the given image by 180 degrees.

```Note : You cannot use the method we used in the demo```

## Bonus Task

Write the code to rotate the given image by any arbitary angle, as can be seen in the example below. try both bound and non-bound. 

``` Do not use any inbuilt function for this task. Use only Numpy for rotation```

<img width="640" height="450" src="../../assets/images/rotate.png">  

**OUTPUT**

|<img width="640" height="450" src="../../assets/images/rotate-no-bound.png">|<img width="640" height="450" src="../../assets/images/rotate-bound.png">|
